Coding Katas
============

These are [coding-katas](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue) written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

They are the result of the coding-dojos of the [Vienna Scala User Group](http://scala-vienna.org/).

Each kata is quite small, typically:

* 1 for the implementation
* 1 for the tests

Since they are small, all katas are contained in one single project.
