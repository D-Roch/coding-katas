Coding Katas
============

These are [coding-katas](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue) 
written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

They are the result of the coding-dojos of the 
[Vienna Scala User Group](http://scala-vienna.org/).

Each kata is quite small, typically consisting of:

* 1 file for the tests
* 1 file for the implementation

Since they are small, all katas are contained in one single project.

List of Katas to implement:

* hangman (word guessing)
* tic-tac-toe
* rock, paper, scissors
* eeny, meeny, miny, moe
* minesweeper (numbers)
* algorithms / data-structures: quicksort, tree, etc.
* binar/hex number translator
* morse code?
* vendor machine (money change)
